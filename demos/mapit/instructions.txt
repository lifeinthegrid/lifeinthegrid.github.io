== DESCRIPTION ==

MapIt is an open source jQuery enabled plug-in that interacts with Google maps API.
The plug-in is designed to make navigating and finding key coordinates anywhere in 
the world a simple process. Completely driven by XML, this plug-in helps you group 
and organize all your location links. The easy and simple to edit XML configuration 
file allows you to create groupings of your coordinates, and display them in a 
hierarchical format. Clicking on the link coordinate will automatically find the point
of interest on the Google map. This plug-in is great for organizing and simplifying
your maps.

== QUICK GUIDE ==

Note:
	- This plugin will only work from an  "http(s)://" path 
	- DO NOT try and use from a path such as "file:///"
	- The demos make references to Google’s CDN network which will require internet access
	- To see the plugin extract the zip file to your web server then browse to index.html

1. The easiest way to get started with the plugin is to just use one of the existing demos source code.

2. Move the source code to the location on your web server that you desire.

3. Inside each demo is a comment section labeled: "REQUIRED FOR MAPIT" make sure all this code is 
included and the paths map correctly to the locations of where you moved each file.

4. Do not set "cacheXml" to true until you go live.  If you are dynamically generating the xml 
file then leave the cacheXml to false.
